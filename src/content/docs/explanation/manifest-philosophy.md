# The Manifest Philosophy

Our team follows a **Documentation-First, AI-Augmented** workflow. Every project begins with a `MANIFEST.md` and a **V0 Documentation Site**.

## The Dual-User Theory
We write documentation for two distinct users:
1. **The Human (Developer/End-User):** Needs to understand the "How-to" and "Tutorials."
2. **The LLM (Assistant):** Needs the "Explanation" and "Reference" to generate V1+ code that aligns with our architectural intent.

## The Standard Structure
Every repository must contain:
* `MANIFEST.md`: The strategic intent.
* `docs/`: The V0 site (Astro/Starlight).
* `README.md`: Local setup instructions.
